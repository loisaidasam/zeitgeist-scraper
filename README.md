zeitgeist-scraper
=================

A collection of year-end music lists from across the blogosphere. Feel free to contribute!

The language or methodology for these scrapers isn't as important as the end result. I'd like to have a collection of .csv files with three columns: #, artist name, and album name. If a blog has a tie for two albums, that's fine, just use the same # for both.

Hopefully once we have all of the data, someone (or myself) can put together a website that displays them all in one common easy-to-read format.
